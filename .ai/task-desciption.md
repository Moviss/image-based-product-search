# **AI full-stack programming task: Image-Based Product Search**

# **Goal**

Build a focused full-stack application that lets a user upload an image of a furniture item and receive **relevant matches** from a furniture catalog, optionally refined by a short natural-language query. We will evaluate the quality and relevance of the matches, not just whether the system returns results.

You are encouraged to use AI coding tools; ownership of the final result and all implementation decisions is entirely yours.

## **Product Catalog**

Connect to the pre-populated database using the following **read-only** connection string:

```
mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@catalog.sontifs.mongodb.net/catalog
```

Use the `products` collection. Each document has the following schema:

```json
{
	"title": string,
	"description": string,
	"category": string,
	"type": string,
	// Price in $
	"price": number,
	// Dimensions in cm
	"width": number,
	"height": number,
	"depth": number
}
```

You may **not** modify the database — use it and its existing indexes as they are.

## **Requirements**

### **AI Provider**

Choose any **frontier model provider** (e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.). The application must accept the user's own API key at runtime — store it **in memory only** (client-side or server-side); do not persist it to disk.

### **Core Features**

- **Image upload** — accept a product image from the user.
- **Product matching** — analyze the image and return ranked matches from the catalog.
- **Optional user prompt** — allow the user to add a natural-language query to narrow or adjust results.

### **Admin**

The client must include an **admin page or tab** — this is an **internal, back-office interface**, not consumer-facing. It serves as the configuration surface for the product matching functionality. Any meta-parameters that control retrieval and ranking behavior should be exposed here.

### **Evaluation**

Think about how you would evaluate the quality of the matching results. Document your approach in the README — and if feasible, incorporate a lightweight evaluation mechanism into the system.

### **Edge Cases**

Graceful handling of edge cases (e.g. unrecognizable images, API failures, no good matches) is nice to have, but less important than the quality of the core retrieval and ranking functionality.

## **Principles**

Apply software design principles — **KISS**, **DRY**, separation of concerns, and clear abstractions. Keep the architecture simple and straightforward, avoid over-engineering, and extract shared logic rather than duplicating it. Clean, readable code is valued over clever code.

## **Stack**

- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript
- **Backend:** Node.js + TypeScript

## **Deliverables**

- A **Git repository** containing the full solution.
- The repository's `README.md` must include:
    - Clear instructions to run the system locally.
    - A **concise overview** of the system — key design choices, considerations, and tradeoffs. Focus on the retrieval and ranking implementation.
    - A list of **future features or enhancements** you would recommend implementing next.
- A `CHANGELOG.md` file that includes:
    - The main changes made through the development of the project, with concise reasons and motivations. Where relevant, include the corresponding prompts and instructions given to the coding agent.
    - Particular focus on the search functionality and its implementation.

## **Follow-Up**

Be prepared to walk through a live demo, explain your implementation, and discuss how you would incorporate further features and modifications in a follow-up conversation.
